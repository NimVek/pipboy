## Discover

### PC & PS4

The app send following broadcast packet to **UDP/28000**
```json
{"cmd": "autodiscover"}
```
It send receives a packet containing Information about the game.
The machine type is either `PC` or `PS4`.
```json
{"IsBusy": false, "MachineType": "PC"}
```

### XBox One

The app sends a 16 byte broadcast packet to port **UDP/5050**
The content is omitted because of possible privacy issues. (Can anyone explain me the protocol? Its XBox standard.)

## Communication

On PC and PS4 the App connects to the Game ob Port **TCP/27000**
All data of the communication ist little-endian.
The resulting stream can be separated in individual packets of following style.
```C
struct Packet {
  uint32_t size,
  uint8_t channel,
  uint8_t content[size]
}
```

### Channel 0 (KeepAlive)

The size of the packets are always *zero*, so no additional information are served.
If not data is send a KeepAlive packet is send every second.

### Channel 1 (ConnectionAccepted)

On connect the first and only packet the Game sends contains some additional Info about the game.

```JSON
{"lang": "de", "version": "1.1.30.0"}
```

### Channel 2 (ConnectionRefused)

Signals the game is busy and your are not allowed to logon.
The size of the packets are always *zero*.

### Channel 3 (DataUpdate)

This channel contains binary data the second packet of the server contains the whole database.
Future packets do only updates to database.
The database ist is a array of items while lists or dicts reference to the indexes of the array.

```C
struct Entry {
  uint8_t type;
  uint32_t id;
  switch (type) {
    case 0:
      uint8_t boolean;
      break;
    case 1:
      sint8_t integer;
      break;
    case 2:
      uint8_t integer;
      break;
    case 3:
      sint32_t integer;
      break;
    case 4:
      uint32_t integer;
      break;
    case 5:
      float32_t floating_point;
      break;
    case 6:
      char_t *string; // zero-terminated
      break;
    case 7: // list
      uint16_t count;
      uint32_t references[count];
      break;
    case 8:
      uint16_t insert_count;
      DictEntry[insert_count];
      uint16_t remove_count;
      uint32_t references[remove_count];
      break;
  }
};

struct DictEntry {
      uint32_t reference;
      char_t *name; // zero-terminated
};
```
#### Example Database

Following JSON

```JSON
{ "foo" : 
  { "bar": "baz",
    "list": [ "one", "two", 3 ]
  }
}
```

will result in this database

| Index  |  Value | 
|---|---|
| 0 | { "foo": 1 } |
| 1 | { "bar": 2, "list": 3 } |
| 2 | "baz" |
| 3 | [ 4, 5, 6 ] |
| 4 | "one" |
| 5 | "two" |
| 6 | 3 |

### Channel 4 (LocalMapUpdate)

The game sends binary imagedata wich is displayed if you choose local map on your app.
Its seems to be rendered each time so maybe, we are able to detect movement? Lets see in future ;)

```C
struct Extend {
  float32_t x,
  float32_t y
}

struct Map {
      uint32_t width,
      uint32_t height,
      Extend nw,
      Extend ne,
      Extend sw,
      uint8_t pixel[ width * height ]
}
```

### Channel 5 (Command)

The app send commands to the game over this channel.
The type is seen in range of 0 to 14, the args differ on type and the id increments with every command send.
```JSON
{"type": 1, "args": [4207600675, 7, 494, [0, 1]], "id": 3}
```

|  #  |  Description  |  Args  | Comment  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  0  |  UseItem  |  `[ <HandleId>, 0, <$.Inventory.Version> ]`  | Use an instance of item specified by `<HandleId>`  |
|  1  |  DropItem  |  `[ <HandleId>, <count>, <$.Inventory.Version>, <StackID> ]`  | Drop `<count>` instances of item, `<StackID>` is the whole list under `StackID`  |
|  2  |  SetFavorite  |  `[<HandleId>, <StackID>, <position>, <$.Inventory.Version>]` | Put item on favorite `<position>` counts from far left 0 to right 5, and north 6 to south 11  |
|  3  |  ToggleComponentFavorite  |  `[<ComponentFormId>, <$.Inventory.Version>]` | Toggle *Tag for search* on component specified by `<ComponentFormId>`  |
|  4  |  SortInventory  |  `[<page>]` | Cycle through search mode on inventory page ( 0: Weapons, 1: Apparel, 2: Aid, 3: Misc, 4: Junk, 5: Mods, 6: Ammo )  |
|  5  |  ToggleQuestActive  |  `[<formId>, <instance>, <type>]` | Toggle marker for quest (values found in $.Quests[x]) |
|  6  |  SetCustomMapMarker  |  `[ <x>, <y>, <local> ]` | Place custom marker at `<x>,<y>`, if `<local>` then on local map else on global  |
|  7  |  RemoveCustomMapMarker  |  `[]`  | remove custom marker  |
|  8  |  CheckFastTravel  |   |   |
|  9  |  FastTravel  |  `[<id>]` | Fast travel to location with index `<id>` in database  |
|  10  |  MoveLocalMap  |   |   |
|  11  |  ZoomLocelMap  |   |   |
|  12  |  ToggleRadioStation  |  `[<id>]`  |  Toggle radio with index `<id>` in database   |
|  13  |  RequestLocalMapSnapshot  |  `[]`   |  Request update of local map   |
|  14  |  ClearIdle  |  `[]`   |  Refresh?? Command with no result   |

### Channel 6 (CommandResult)

Is a response channel for commands sends by app, only seen for command type `8` and `9`

```JSON
{"allowed":true,"id":3,"success":true}
```
```JSON
{"allowed":false,"id":3,"message":"Du tr√§gst zu viel und kannst daher nicht schnellreisen!","success":false}
```
